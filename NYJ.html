        <h2>Born a crime</h2>
        <p>Born a Crime is a book that narrates the life of a young mixed-colored man growing up in South Africa during the apartheid period. The first two chapters tell his biographical story. Raised by his young, Storch Christian mother, he was expected to follow the same faith. However, he was not very interested in it as he found his fellow students more knowledgeable about the world than he was.
            
            Trevor was a notorious child who was always on the run with his mother, which he believes is why they were the best racers in school competitions.
            
            After Nelson Mandela was released, Trevor noticed more bloodshed than before due to the struggle for power between tribal political parties.</p>He explains that, during the apartheid period, it was a crime for black people to interact with whites, and mixed children were considered a crime since whites were considered superior. Trevor describes himself as a sign of his parents' crime, as his father was a Swiss/German man and his mother a Xhosa woman.
            
            Despite the stigma surrounding mixed-race children, Trevor believes that his parents genuinely love each other. He is unsure why they separated.
            
            The title of the book, "Born a Crime," was derived from the fact that Trevor was a mixed child during the apartheid.
            
            From these two chapters, we learn that sometimes, in our efforts to move forward, we forget, where we come from and lose everything. For instance, during Uganda's liberation period, people were together as one, regardless of tribe. However, after the victory, it seemed like every tribe was on its continent.
